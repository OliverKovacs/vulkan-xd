## Todo:
- UBO wrapper struct for dynamic length UBOs
- dynamic creation/destruction of SSBOs
- dynamic descriptor sets
- dynamic shader compilation
- officially support building on Windows
- dynamic push constants 
- implement transformation matrices
- implement scene graphs
- dynamic layout indexing of UBOs/SSBOs/Textures in shader
- implement proper ECS
- implement (optional) in-shader vertex indexing
- evaluate storing once processed vertex positions in a writeable SSBO as a substitute for post-T&L caching
- implement wireframe rendering
